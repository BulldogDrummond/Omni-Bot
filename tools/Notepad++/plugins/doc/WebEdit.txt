WebEdit v.1.4 - freeware open-source plugin for Notepad++.

INTRODUCTION

This plugin allows you to define up to 30 commands. Each command will surround
the currently selected text with the Left and Right text defined for the
command. If there is no selection, the Left text is inserted to the left of
current caret position, and the Right text is inserted to the right. In any
case the selection and relative cursor position are preserved. Clipboard is
not used. Both text insertions can be undone/redone as a single action.

INSTALLATION AND SETUP

To use this plugin you have to copy two files:
- file 1: either WebEdit.dll (if you use ANSI version of Notepad++) 
  or WebEditU.dll (for the Unicode version) to Notepad++\plugins\ folder;
- file 2: WebEdit.ini to Notepad++\plugins\Config\ folder.
Both folders are to be found either in "Program Files" or in "Application Data"
of your current user, depending on whether you installed Notepad++ in the
Portable mode or not. (Hint: to determine whether Notepad++ is installed in
Portable mode, check for the existence of "doLocalConf.xml" file in the
Notepad++ folder. If the file is present, Portable mode is in effect,
otherwise it is not.) If the WebEdit.dll file is not installed, you will not
see the "WebEdit" menu under the Plugins menu. If the WebEdit.ini file is not
installed, you will see that the Plugins - WebEdit menu consists entirely of
disabled items.
The Config folder of the distribution package contains a sample WebEdit.ini
and a sample bitmap for the toolbar button.

The WebEdit plugin allows you to create commands to wrap the selected text in
tags. The commands are to be defined in the "[Commands]" section of the
WebEdit.ini file. Ini-file format:
- a character with code below 32 (space) terminates a line (i.e. end-of-line
  sequence does not matter), the only exception is the tab character;
- line length must not exceed 1022 characters (if a longer line is encountered,
  file processing is aborted at that point);
- any line starting with a semicolon character (;) is considered a comment and
  ignored;
- the file may contain any number of any sections. A section is a line of the
  following format: "[" <section name> "]". Only the sections with supported
  names are processed in order of appearance, all others are ignored.

The "[Commands]" section format:
- if you want a line to contain a non-printable character, you must escape it
  with a backslash; the following escape sequences are supported:
  - \t = 09 - tab character;
  - \n = 10 - line feed (LF) character;
  - \r = 13 - carriage return (CR) character;
  - \\ = "\" - double backslash is replaced with a single backslash. This is
    required if you don't want "\t", "\n", etc. to be escaped: just write
    "\\t" and you will get "\t";
  - any other characters after the backslash are not escaped, e.g. "\a" = "\a";
- the minimum valid line is "=|" any line not containing "=" and "|" after it
  is ignored;
- line syntax: [menu item] "=" [Left text] "|" [Right text], for example:
  "Paragraph=<p>|</p>";
- syntax explanation:
  - [menu item] is the text displayed in the plugin menu ("Paragraph"));
  - [Left text] is the text inserted to the left of current selection ("<p>");
  - [Right text] is the text inserted to the right of current selection ("</p>");
  - all of the above strings are optional;
  - limitations: you can't use "=" in the menu text, and you can't use "|" in
    the Left text.
At most 30 commands may be defined in the "[Commands]" section, all superfluous
commands are ignored. The defined commands are listed in the plugin menu in the
order they appear in the file. Unused menu slots appear as disabled and show
text "WebEdit Slot XX", where XX is the number of the slot. The first slot is
numbered "01".

You may edit the ini-file in Notepad++ by selecting "Edit Config" command from
Plugins - WebEdit menu. Edit the file, save it, and update the plugin
configuration by selecting "Load Config" command from the Plugins - WebEdit
menu (you don't have to restart Notepad++, but note that toolbar is only
updated on startup).

The "[Toolbar]" section determines which of the command slots will be placed on
the toolbar. Syntax: <slot number> "=" <file name>
Example: 1=Paragraph.bmp
Slot numbers are 1..30. The file should be placed in the plugins/Config folder
and should contain a bitmap image suitable for the toolbar.

To display custom toolbar buttons Notepad++ should be configured to use "Small
standard icons" (it is by default). To find this option go to the "Settings -
Preferences..." menu, and in the "Global" tab look for the "Tool bar" group.

You may assign shortcuts to the plugin menu items via Settings - Shortcut
Mapper - Plugin commands. If you are running Notepad++ 5.0 and later, you will
see the actual command names, i.e. instead of the dummy text "WebEdit Slot XX"
you will see "WebEdit - Command name", where the "Command name" is the text as
displayed in the plugin menu. Due to insufficient support of the dynamic menus
by Notepad++ the text in the Shortcut Mapper will only be updated on restart.

Hint: if you want to set a menu accelerator, use ampersand character (&) in the
menu item text. For example: "&Paragraph tag=<p>|</p>". The character after the
ampersand ("P" in this case) will be underlined in the plugin menu, which makes
it possible to simply type "p" on the keyboard instead of selecting the menu
item with mouse or cursor keys. The accelerator, of course, will only work when
the plugin menu is displayed (press "Alt+p, w" to display the "Plugins -
WebEdit" menu).

PS: If you feel that the limit of 30 functions maximum is too constricting, you
may painlessly increase the number up to 99, but you will have to recompile the
plugin. See instructions in the WebEdit.ob2 source file.
