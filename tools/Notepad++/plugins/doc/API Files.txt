API files are located in the plugins\APIs\ subfolder of the Notepad++ installation 
folder. These files are optional: you need only one for each language for which 
you'll use Auto Completion or calltips. They are also supported for User Defined 
Languages, and bear the name <Language name>.xml.

Under the usual <Notepad-plus> tag is a <AutoComplete> tag. It has an optional, 
unused "language" attribute, which you can use for any descriptive purpose.

The contents of a <AutoComplete> start with an autoclosing <Environment> tag, with 
the following attributes:

   1. ignoreCase: "no" if the language is case sensitive, else "yes" (default);
   2. startFunc: the character(s) which start the parameter list: Default is "(";
   3. stopFunc: the character(s) which end the parameter list: Default is ")";
   4. paramSeparator: the character(s) which separate parameters. Defaults to ",";
   5. terminal: the character(s) which mark the end of a prototype, when the 
      language allows C-style separate prototyping. Defaults to ";". Leave it out if 
      the language does not support separate prototyping, or set it to some illegal 
      character.
   6. additionalWordChar: character(s) that may be part of words and which are 
      not a lower or upper case letter, a digit or the underscore. The value is a 
      string with all these extra characters, in any order and without separators. 

Any attribute can be omitted, and the <Environment> tag as well. The practice is 
not recommended though.
